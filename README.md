# What is the problem

Ageing well is an urgent and pressing issue across Australian society. Over the past two decades, the number of persons aged 85 years and over increased by 148%, compared with a total population growth of 32.1% over the same period.

Cognitive decline, and in particular short term memory loss, occurs for most people in their late 80s and 90s, and even earlier for those who do not enjoy good physical heath. Moreover, the majority of older people retain the ability to care for themselves, even with the onset of dementia.

However, there is a major problem challenging the ability of older Australians to care for themselves. Many older people are not able to maintain good health because:

* remembering,
* attending medical appointments,
* taking medications and
* keeping socially interactive
* are more challenging.

As people begin to lose cognitive ability, many will use a calendar or diary to help remember and organise their outings and appointments. The diaries of people with dementia and memory problems often become cluttered with notes as they attempt to keep all the details that they may forget. Over time, the ability to plan diminishes and diary and calendar notes disappear, or are written by others.

Help us help the nearly half a million Australians aged 85 years and over maintain good health by building a better diary, calendar, social interaction and medication reminder solution.

# Possible Solutions

* A tablet that allows multiple agencies and family members remote access
* A Display at the clients home that has clear information on what will be happening today
* Ability for the care team to access the tablet and avoid booking appointments that will clash with other events
* An easy alert system with a reminders for medications
* Ability to dial the client and have a ‘facetime’ conversation
* A clear contact list display with a phone call made at the touch of the screen
